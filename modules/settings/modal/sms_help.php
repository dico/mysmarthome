		<h3><?php echo _('Get a provider'); ?></h3>

		<p>There exist many SMS providers, you are free to use whatever provider you want. 
		If you are new SMS, here are some easy sugestions to get you started. 
		These are third-party suggestions, so we do not provide any support on the gateways themselves.</p>

		<br />

		<h4>Clickatell</h4>
		<div style="margin-left:10px;">
			<p><a href="https://www.clickatell.com/" target="_blank">Clickatell</a> is a standard international 
			SMS provider in the cloud, with no starting fee. Clickatell will get you started within five minutes.</p>

			<p>All you need is to register an account and fill up some money. You pay for each sent SMS.
			You can also set up automatic payment.</p>

			<p>After you have registered an account, you will receive a username, password and API-code to insert into our Add provider form.</p>

		<h4>In-house SMS Gateway</h4>
		<div style="margin-left:10px;">
			<p><a href="http://www.diafaan.com/" target="_blank">Diafaan</a> is a Windows compatible software 
				that supports multiple GSM modems, of multiple brands.</p>

			<p>Diafaan allows you to own your own SMS gateway with own hardware, your only cost is the Diafaan license ($195 - $995)
			and a GSM modem ($10-$20).</p>

			<p>We personally has good experience with the Huawei E220 3G modem as an SMS GSM modem. 
			You can buy this at 
			<a href="http://tinyurl.com/l7aga6g" target="_blank">Ebay</a> for as low as $10.</p>

			<p>We can be helpful with Diafaan installation for a standard hour fee - but we recommend using Diafaan support and forum for help.</p>
